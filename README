High level driver to control a Universal Robot robot from python through its TCP/IP interface
urx.py is the main file in this repository. It is a python library to control an UR robot from python. Internally it uses URSCript.
urx can optionally use the math3d library to receive and send transformation matrices to the robot
ursecmon.py is a parser for the binary data from the UR
urrtmon.py is a parser for the "real-time" interface of the robot. It is hardcoded for some controller versions and therefore disabled by default
