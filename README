urx.py is the main file in this repository. It is a python library to control an UR robot from python. Internally it uses URSCript.
urx can optionally use the python-math3d https://launchpad.net/pymath3d library to receive and send transformation matrices to the robot
ursecmon.py is a parser for the binary data from the UR
urrtmon.py is a parser for the "real-time" interface of the robot. It is hardcoded for some controller versions and therefore disabled by default
